Attendance System Using Face Recognition (Deep Learning & Machine Learning)
📌 Project Overview
This project implements an Attendance System using Face Recognition, leveraging Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques to ensure real-time, accurate, and automated attendance tracking.

🚀 Key Features
Real-Time Face Detection & Recognition: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract facial features and identify individuals accurately.
High Accuracy: Trained on diverse facial datasets to reduce false positives and enhance detection performance.
Efficient Attendance Logging: Automatically marks attendance in a structured format after successful recognition.
Scalability: Designed for easy integration into larger attendance or security systems.
⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV for real-time image processing
Keras / TensorFlow for building and training the CNN model
Pandas for data manipulation and attendance logging
